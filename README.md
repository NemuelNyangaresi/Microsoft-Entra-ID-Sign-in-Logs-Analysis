# Microsoft Entra ID Sign-in Logs Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I delve deep into Microsoft Entra ID Sign-in Logs Analysis, gaining comprehensive insights into user authentication patterns, behaviors, and anomalies. I focus on the detailed examination of sign-in logs, which are essential for understanding user activities and strengthening security monitoring.<br />

The logs include vital data such as:<br />

- Successful logins<br />
- Failed login attempts<br />
- User information<br />
- IP addresses<br />
- Timestamps<br />
- Geolocations<br />

By analyzing this data, organizations can detect and respond to security incidents effectively.
